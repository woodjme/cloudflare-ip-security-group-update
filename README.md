# Cloudflare's IP address list > AWS Security Group and S3 Policies

This Lambda function to retrieve Cloudflare's IP address list and
update an AWS Security Group and S3 Policies.

It was originally written by John McCracken (johnmccuk@gmail.com),  
updated by Ryan Gibbons (rtgibbons) and Endrigo Antonini (antonini).

We have made a fork that we are expanding and optimizing for our use cases and hopefully for more generic use cases. It could at some point be a version two written in go. Hans Øyvind Laderud (afreakk) and Christian Sakshaug (csakshaug) supporting this fork on behalf of dx.

## Instructions

### Serverless

Serverless will automatically create and manage a security group in the specified vpc.
And add cloudflare ips to its inbound rules on ports specified.
(S3 permissions is not set up in serverless.yml because i dont need it, but you can uncomment the permissions in serverless.yml)

```bash
serverless deploy  --vpcid "vpc-12345678912345678" --ports "80,443"
```

### Manual

Use the content of the file `cf-security-group-update.py` in your lambda ou upload it.

It is also required that you upload or create the `package` file as is available on this repository.

The Lambda uses the Python 2.7 runtime and requires the following
enviroment variables:

* `SECURITY_GROUP_IDS_LIST` - security group ID(s) to update `sg-12345678912345678,s3-11122223333344444`
* `PORTS_LIST` - port(s) to update `80,443` or `80` (defaults to 80 if none specified)
* `S3_CLOUDFLARE_SID` - Sid that stores all the CloudFlare configurataion. That Sid is stored on the Stament policy.
* `S3_BUCKET_IDS_LIST` - S3 buckets ID(s) to update

You need to allow the Lambda to execute those actions (example on the file `allow-lambda-ingress-role`:

* ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
* ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress
* ec2:DescribeSecurityGroup
* s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus
* s3:PutBucketPolicy
* s3:GetBucketPolicy

## To update Security Groups

You need to define `SECURITY_GROUP_IDS_LIST`.
The parameter `PORTS_LIST` is also used to update an AWS Security Group.

## To update S3 Policy

You need to define the parameters `S3_CLOUDFLARE_SID` and `S3_BUCKET_IDS_LIST`.
